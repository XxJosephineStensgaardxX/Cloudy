                <p>
                    We like win-win situations. When we produce and sell our socks it is beneficial for everyone involved.
                    The sells person has a nice job. The raw materials are gained in such a way it does not harm the earth. The production is done with the
                    enivironment in mind and with an honest waige for the people working in the factories. The shops that sell our sock make a fair provit. And last but not least: the costumer gets high quality socks for a fair price.
